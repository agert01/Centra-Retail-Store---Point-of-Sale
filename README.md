¬Executive Summary


The main aim of this project is  to learn how to program in Python, with particular emphasis using the Tkinter GUI library.


The application that has been developed is called “ Centra Retail Store”.


Essentially, what the app does is it requires a user to log in with their account, where upon successful login they can get an idea what Centra stores are about, do a bit of shopping If they wish, and at the end they have the option to evaluate and give feedback about the experience they had during the trial of the application/retail store. The user has  the option to create a new account in case he does not already have one.


In this application the following topics have been included which are part of the tkinter library in python



1)	Data Management

2)	Labels and Messages

4)	Entry 

5)	Screen Design – Layout management – primarily using grid

6)	Radio buttons and CheckButtons

7)	Canvas
